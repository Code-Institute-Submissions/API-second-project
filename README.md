# API-Second-Project

This project focuses on using JavaScript to connect the Spooncular API. The website was built with the intention of helping people find recipes based on the ingredients they have in the fridge. The website is designed to be intuitive and easy to navigate. 
It is targeted towards users who are interested in cooking, finding recipes based on ingredients, and following along to videos as they are prepping and cooking. The website not only promotes Spooncular, but It also provides users with an option to either visit the official Spooncular website or search for recipes on the current website. This website allows users to easily follow along with the online videos without having to read a list of instructions. Watching videos also gives them the ease to pause the video or rewind if they have missed a step.
